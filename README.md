Question Paper Simulator
Hello everyone! I'm Vaishnavi Mishra, and today I'll be showing you how I created the Question Paper Simulator project during my time at UPES. 
In this project I created a project about a question paper simulator and it was a very thrilling as well as hardworking experience.
This question paper includes three subjects as well as my program includes- GUI Library(tkinter), concepts of file handling, randomization, error handling as well as csv files.
The working of this project includes - loading of subjects then the user will select answers according to his/her choice and then at the end the results will be displayed on the gui interface.
This is the working of this project.
